##IN PROGRESS
##An Ionic example that works (in the browser, simulator, and on an iOS device)

When building my first Ionic app I had trouble finding and example that worked across platforms and I also ran into some small details that tripped me up, especially when looking to make my app work on the next platform (i.e. it worked in simulator! why isn't it working on the iphone?!)... so here's a demo that I've verified works across the browser, simulator, and on an iOS device.

`ionic start puppies sidemenu`
`cd puppies`
`ionic serve --lab`
